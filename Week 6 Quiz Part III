## Question 1 On your test set results, what is the conditional entropy of default, conditional on your test classifications? Hint:
Refer back to the Test Incidence, Positive Predictive Value and Negative Predictive Value of your Test from Part 1
Conditional entropy of default is H( X | Y )

Hint: Hint: you need your model s true positive rate from Part 1, Question 12, and test � � incidence [proportion of events your model 
classifies as default] from Part 1, � question 13. Use the condition incidence of 25% and your model s True Positive rate �
to calculate the portion of TPs. Then you have the inputs needed to use the Information Gain Calculator Spreadsheet.

## Question 2 On your test set results, what is the Mutual Information, or information Gain, in average bits per event 
(information gain calculated in units of bits per event)?
Mutual information (Info. gain) calculated in units of bits per event and information Gain, in average bits per event are the same. 
The question was repeating itself to make it more clear.

## Question 3 What is the Percentage Information Gain (PIG) of your test?
Percentage Information Gain (PIG) = Information Gain/initial entropy

## Question 4 How many dollars does the bank save, for every bit of information gain achieved by your model?
Dollar saving = your dollar saved per event / your information gain. The numbers given in the question are used as samples, 
just replace those numbers with the numbers you have.

## Question 5 Information Gain of Eggertopia Scores over the Base Rate On the test set, What is the information gain, in average 
bits per event, over the base rate of (.25, .75) offered by the Eggertopia Scores?

Given
Base Rate = (0.25, 0.75)
PPV = 0.48 [from part 2]
NPV = 0.888 [from part 2]

Find
Information Gain

Calculate
Base rate = H(X) = .25*log[2](1/.25)+.75*log[2](1/.75)
Model rate = H(X|Y) = c*H(PPV, 1-PPV) + d*H(1-NPV, NPV)
Information Gain = Base rate - Model rate = H(X) - H(X|Y)

Comment: 
.1305 bits per event x

## Question 6 On the test set, what is the Eggertopia scores’ Percentage Information Gain (PIG)?
Percentage Information Gain (PIG) = Information Gain/initial entropy

Comment: 
15.25% x

## Question 7 If Eggertopia data were free, and your model were unavailable, what would the dollar savings per bit of information
extracted be?
Saving per bit = $ saved / bits extracted

Comment: 
Value would be $427 per bit. x

## Question 8 What is the incremental information gain of the Eggertopia scores, over your model, in average bits per event, if any?
If your model has higher information gain that eggertopia, Just give a negative number.

## Question 9 What is the maximum (break-even) price the bank should pay for Eggertopia scores, per score, if your model and data are 
already available?
If your model is better than Eggertopia, then pay negative value to Eggertopia. The answer will depend on your model.

## Question 10 At the above maximum (break-even) price per score, what would be the value per bit of incremental information gained 
from the Eggertopia scores? Give your answer in $/bit.
Dividing maximum price the bank should pay (Question 8) by incremental information gain (Question 9)
