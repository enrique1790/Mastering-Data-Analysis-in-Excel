Question 1 Suppose we have two coins: one “fair” coin, where p(head) = p(tails) = .5; and an “unfair” coin where p(heads) does not equal
p(tails). Which coin has a larger entropy prior to observing the outcome?
Less is known about the result of fair coin and thus it has higher entropy. In other words, we know more about the unfair coin since it
favors one direction than the other, therefore unfair coin has lower entropy.

Comment: The coin that is harder to predict is the one with the greater entropy.

Question 2
1. It is a 6-sided fair dice, which means the probability for getting each of the 6 different outcome is 1/6.
2. Given a probability, the entropy that that probability is p*log2(1/p). Hence, the entropy for each of the 6 different outcome is 
(using Excel) =(1/6)*LOG(1/6,2) = 0.430827083.
3. What we are interested in is H(X), the entropy of all possible outcomes. To get H(X), multiply the above answer by 6,
0.430827083*6 = 2.584962501 ~ 2.58
A simple three-step problem

Question 3 
If your friend picks one number between 1001 to 5000, under the strategy used in video Entropy of a Guessing Game, what is the 
maximum number of questions you need to ask to find out that number?

Question 4
Use the “Information Gain Calculator” spreadsheet to calculate the "Conditional Entropy" H(X|Y) given a = 0.4, c = 0.5, e = 0.11.


Question 5 On the “Information Measures” spreadsheet 4-1, given a = 0.3, c = 0.2, suppose now we also know that H(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y). 
What is the joint probability e?

H(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y) implies independence, therefore e = a*c

OR

Given
a = 0.3
c = 0.2

Solve
e = 0.3 * 0.2 ; e = .06

Calculation

1) b, d
2) H(X), H(Y), and H(X,Y)
3) e using the following equation
H(X,Y)	= e*log(1/e)	+ f*log(1/f)	+ g*Log(1/g)	+ h*log(1/h)

Comment:
H(X,Y)=H(X)+H(Y) implies that two events are independent. In that case, the joint probability of these two events is P(X)*P(Y).
Putting everything in the context of the Confusion Matrix, X is the conditions (+ or -), Y is the classifications (Positive or Negative)
, e takes the place of True Positive. The "joint probability e" is the joint probability of Condition + and Classification Positive. 
Since these two events are independent, the joint probability is the product of the probability of "+" and probability of Positive.
The probability of Condition + is given by a. The probability of Classification Positive is given by c. Hence, a*c=0.2*0.3=0.06.

Question 6: Given a = 0.2, c = 0.5 on the Information Gain Calculator Spreadsheet suppose now we also know the true positive rate is 
0.18. What is the Mutual Information?

Answer: .08
Comments:
I'm working on Q6. According to the question,the true positive rate is 0.18. That is to say e/a=0.18 and e= 0.036. However, 
according to the automatically calculated result, the mutual information is 0.0788. And it's not even an option. May you help me 
figure out where I went wrong? thank you.

--> I'm working on this question also. I've followed the same process as Wang; e/a=0.18 and e= 0.036. The automatically calculated
result  of H(X) - H(X|Y) = I(X,Y) =0.7219 - 0.6431=0.0788. As Wang pointed out, that is not an option on the quiz question. Wang 
indicated  this is a silly question, but I am not seeing the mistake. Can you point me in the correct direction?

Question 7-8: Monty Hall Problem Consider the Monty Hall problem, but instead of the usual 4 doors, assume there are 5 doors to choose
from. You first choose door #1. Monty opens doors #2 and #3. What is the new probability that there is a prize behind door #4?

Again, consider the Monty Hall problem, but with 5 doors to choose from instead of 4. You pick door #1, and Monty opens 2 of the other
4 doors. How many bits of information are communicated to you by Monty when you observe which two doors he opens?

We have three situations for doors:
1) the ones you choose but not yet opened (a)
2) the ones Monty opened and no prize (b)
3) the ones left (c)

For 1), probability of prize is constant because Monty's behavior does not change the prize behind the door you choose. P1 = a/(a+ b+ c)
For 2), P = zero because Monty shows you there is no prize behind the door. P2 = 0
For 3), the probability of prize increased because Monty can't choose the doors with prizes. The original probability that the prize 
is behind doors not chosen is constant and equal to 1 - P1 = (b+c)/(a+b+c). But now, b is out of the equation, so P3 = c/(a+c)

Q7) The original Monty Hall problem has three doors. There are a lot of variations, i.e., there are 4 doors and 2 of the doors have 
prizes hidden behind them.

What is the new probability that there is a prize behind door #4?

*There are 5 doors in total. Before Monty opens any door, the probability that the prize could be hidden behind any door is 1/5.
That means the probability that the contestant will miss the prize is 1-1/5 = 4/5
*The contestant opens door#1. There is 1/5 chance that the prize is behind door #1 and 4/5 chance that the prize is behind door#2, 
door#3, door#4, door#5.
*Monty opens doors #2 and #3, revealing that these two doors are non-winning. After that, the 4/5 falls on the doors that the 
contestant did not choose and Monty did not open: doors #4 and #5. There is an equal chance that the prize could be behind #4 or #5. 
Hence, the "the new probability that there is a prize behind door #4" is (4/5)*(1/2) = 2/5 or 0.4

Question 9: Learn from One Coin Toss

B stands for “the coin is fair”, ~B stands for “the coin is crooked”. The p(heads | B) = 0.5, and p(heads | ~B) = 0.4. Your friend 
tells you that he often tests people to see if they can guess whether he is using the fair coin or the crooked coin, but that he is 
careful to use the crooked coin 70% of the time. He tosses the coin once and it comes up heads.

What is your new best estimate of the probability that the coin he just tossed is fair?

Given:
P(heads | B) = 0.5
P(heads | ~B) = 0.4
P(~B) = 0.7

Solve:
P(B | heads)

Calculations:
P(B) = 1 - P(~B)
P(heads) = P(B) * P(heads | B) + P(~B) * P(heads | ~B)
P(B | heads) = P(heads | B) * P(B) / P(heads)

Question 10: Learn from One Coin Toss
Suppose you are given either a fair die or an unfair die (6-sided). You have no basis for considering either die more likely before 
you roll it and observe an outcome. For the fair die, the chance of observing “3” is 1/6. For the unfair die, the chance of observing
“3” is 1/3. After rolling the unknown die, you observe the outcome to be 3.

What is the new probability that the die you rolled is fair?

Given:
P(3 | fair) = 1/6
P(3 | unfair) = 1/3
P(fair) = 0.5 and P(unfair) = 0.5

Solve:
P(fair | 3)

Calculations:
P(3) = P(fair) * P(3 | fair) + P(unfair) * P(3 | unfair)
P(fair | 3) = P(3 | fair) * P(fair) / P(3)

Other Hints
Hints are given as comments for your answer, you will see them after submitting.
Let me know if you have further questions here.

Q8) in its original words: "How many bits of information are communicated to you by Monty when you observe which two doors he opens?" 
The problem is essentially asking: how much uncertainty Monty eliminated by opening two doors?

The amount of uncertainty eliminated equals to the amount uncertainty before any door is open subtract the amount of uncertainty after 
2 doors are open. We denote uncertainty by entropy. For example, the uncertainty before any door is open is denoted by H(X). The 
uncertainty after 2 doors are open is denoted by H(X|Y). The question thus boils down to H(X)-H(X|Y) = ?

That is the overall idea, but how do we calculate H(X)? Please remember that H(X) is the total uncertainty before any door is open. 
Each of the 5 doors has an equal chance of 1/5 that the prize could be hidden behind it.
H(X)=5*H(1/5)=5*(1/5)*LOG2(1/(1/5)) =5*(1/5)*LOG2(5/1)

The expression evaluates to 2.32

H(X|Y)=H(1/5, 2/5). The remaining uncertainty after Monty open two doors. (1/5)*LOG2(1/(1/5))+2*(2/5)*LOG2(1/(2/5)) 
= (1/5)*LOG2(5/1)+2*(2/5)*LOG2(5/2)

Please notice that there is a multiplier of 2 to the second part of the expression. That's because after Monty opens 2 doors, 
there are 3 doors remaining open, each with winning probability of 1/5, 2/5, 2/5 (two doors with 2/5 chance of winning). This 
expression evaluates to 1.52.

Hence, the final answer is 5*H(1/5) - 2*H(1/5,2/5) = 2.32-1.52 = (0.8.)

Q9) Known: P(Head|B) = 0.5, P(Head|~B) = 0.4, P( ~B) = 0.7, P(B) = 1-0.7=0.3 (The friend always use the crooked coin 70% of the time. 
That means he always uses the fair coin 1-0.7=0.3 of the time.)

Want: P(B|Head) A head was observed. The problem asks for the "new best estimate of the probability that the coin he just tossed is
fair". This is asking: what is the probability that the coin is fair, given that a head is observed? This is P(B|Head)

The formula for P(B|Head) is P(B|Head) = P(Head|B)*P(B)/P(Head) . We know both P(Head|B) and P(B), but need to find out P(Head) 
(the probability that a head would be observed).

P(Head)=P(Head|B)*P(B)+P(Head|~B)*P(~B) = 0.5*0.3+0.4*0.7=0.43

P(B|Head) = 0.5*0.3/0.43 = ( 0.35 )

Answer:
Comments:
Q10 is very similar to Q9. You will need to apply Bayes' Rule and the Law of Total Probability again. (Please refer to my last post 
for how Bayes' Rule and the Law of Total Probability are applicable.)

Known: P(3|B) = 1/6, P(3|~B) = 1/3. A 3 is observed. P(B)=0.5 (To get this, you need to think a little bit. The question states 
"You have no basis for considering either dice more likely before you roll it and observe an outcome." This sentence means that
there is an equal probability that you will get either a fair coin or crooked coin. Hence, P(B)=P(~B)=0.5)

Wanted: P(B|3) The problem asks "What is the new probability that the die you rolled is fair?" This is asking what is the probability
of tossing a fair coin, given that a 3 is observed, namely, what is P(B|3)

Applying Bayes' Rule, the formula for P(B|3) is P(B|3)=P(3|B)*P(B)/P(3)

P(3|B) and P(B) are both known. Apply Law of Total Probability to P(3).

P(3) = P(3|B)*P(B)+P(3|~B)*P(~B) = (1/6)*0.5+(1/3)*0.5=0.25

Substitute P(3)=0.25 into the formula for P(B|3): (1/6)*0.5/0.25 = 0.33
