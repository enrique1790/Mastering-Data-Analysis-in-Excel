Question 1 What are your values for each “beta” on the training set?
Use the Excel “Linest” function. For more information, please refer to Week 4 video.
*The betas from Linest function are reversed in order

Question 2 What is the root mean square residual error of your model on the standardized training set?
Root mean square residual error = SQRT(1-R^2)

Question 3 What is the Correlation, R, of your model on the training set?
Correlation R = SQRT(R^2); R^2 is given by LINEST function

Question 4 Using the parametric formula [parametric because it assumes inputs and errors are Gaussian and continuous PDF is appropriate]
I(X:Y) = log(1/SQRT(1-R^2)). Assuming results on training set were sustainable (a very big assumption) what is the information gain of
your linear regression model on the training set, in average bits per event?
I(X:Y) = log(1/SQRT(1-R^2))

Question 5 In the Final Project workbook, the 7.4 Datapoints and Questions Spreadsheet lists data for 5 new credit card applicants 
(labeled “Final A,” “Final B,” “Final C,” “Final D,” and “Final E”). Assume the mean profitability is $2,000 and the standard deviation
of profitability is $5,100.
Calculate the expected profit point estimate in dollars ($) for the 5 new applicants.
Profitability = mean + std. profitability * std. deviation

Question 6 What is the profit range that would cover 90% of outcomes (if model performance is assumed stable on future data)
Range = Mean +/- Std.Dev * z-score * Root Mean Square Error

Question 7 What is the root mean square residual error of your model (with betas optimized on the training set), when you run it on 
the test set?

y = Actual profitability
y^ = Predicted profitability using the model with betas from training set
SS1 = Sum of (y-y^)^2
SS2 = Sum of y^2
Root mean square residual error = SQRT(SS1/SS2)

Question 8a What is the Correlation, R, of your model on the test set?*

y = Actual profitability
y^ = Predicted profitability using the model with betas from training set
SS1 = Sum of (y-y^)^2
SS2 = Sum of y^2
R = SQRT(1-SS1/SS2)

Question 8b If your model performs worse on the test set (which I expect it will) this is because the multivariate linear regression
over-fits noise in the original Training Set. However, for now we will not try to correct or improve the original “linest” model.

Using the same parametric assumptions as above, what is the information gain of the linear regression model on the training set, 
in average bits per event?
I(X:Y) = log(1/SQRT(1-R^2))

Question 9 Based on your new root mean square error, what is the new 90% confidence interval for your profitability estimates for 
the five applicants above?
Range = Mean +/- Std.Dev * z-score * Root Mean Square Error
