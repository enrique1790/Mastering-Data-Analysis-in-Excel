## Question 1 What are your values for each “beta” on the training set?
Use the Excel “Linest” function. For more information, please refer to Week 4 video.
*The betas from Linest function are reversed in order

## Question 2 What is the root mean square residual error of your model on the standardized training set?
Root mean square residual error = SQRT(1-R^2)

## Question 3 What is the Correlation, R, of your model on the training set?
Correlation R = SQRT(R^2); R^2 is given by LINEST function

## Question 4 Using the parametric formula [parametric because it assumes inputs and errors are Gaussian and continuous PDF is appropriate]
I(X:Y) = log(1/SQRT(1-R^2)). Assuming results on training set were sustainable (a very big assumption) what is the information gain of
your linear regression model on the training set, in average bits per event?
I(X:Y) = log(1/SQRT(1-R^2))

## Question 5 In the Final Project workbook, the 7.4 Datapoints and Questions Spreadsheet lists data for 5 new credit card applicants 
(labeled “Final A,” “Final B,” “Final C,” “Final D,” and “Final E”). Assume the mean profitability is $2,000 and the standard deviation
of profitability is $5,100.
Calculate the expected profit point estimate in dollars ($) for the 5 new applicants.
Profitability = mean + std. profitability * std. deviation

## Question 6 What is the profit range that would cover 90% of outcomes (if model performance is assumed stable on future data)
Range = Mean +/- Std.Dev * z-score * Root Mean Square Error

## Question 7 What is the root mean square residual error of your model (with betas optimized on the training set), when you run it on 
the test set?

y = Actual profitability
y^ = Predicted profitability using the model with betas from training set
SS1 = Sum of (y-y^)^2
SS2 = Sum of y^2
Root mean square residual error = SQRT(SS1/SS2)

## Question 8a What is the Correlation, R, of your model on the test set?*

y = Actual profitability
y^ = Predicted profitability using the model with betas from training set
SS1 = Sum of (y-y^)^2
SS2 = Sum of y^2
R = SQRT(1-SS1/SS2)

## Question 8b If your model performs worse on the test set (which I expect it will) this is because the multivariate linear regression
over-fits noise in the original Training Set. However, for now we will not try to correct or improve the original “linest” model.

Using the same parametric assumptions as above, what is the information gain of the linear regression model on the training set, 
in average bits per event?
I(X:Y) = log(1/SQRT(1-R^2))

## Question 9 Based on your new root mean square error, what is the new 90% confidence interval for your profitability estimates for 
the five applicants above?
Range = Mean +/- Std.Dev * z-score * Root Mean Square Error

## Question 10 
For this question, use the Linear Regression Forecasting explanation and Excel spreadsheet.
Question: What is the standard deviation of model error in dollars on the Training Set?
**This may seem similar to question 5, but Q5 refers to the Test Set.

Comment:

## Question 11: For this question, use the Linear Regression Forecasting explanation and Excel spreadsheet.

Question: What is the 90% confidence interval, in dollars, on the Training Set?
**This may seem similar to question 6, but Q6 refers to the Test Set.

Comment:

## Question 12: For this question, use the Linear Regression Forecasting explanation and Excel spreadsheet.

Question: What is the Percentage Information Gain (P.I.G.) on the Training Set?
**This may seem similar to question 7, but Q7 refers to the Test Set.

## Question 13 : Questions 13 through 15 use the same example applicant.
The following data are known about the sample applicant:

Age: 42.00
Years at Employer: 12.44
Years at Address: 0.9
Income: $121,400
CC debt: -34,228
Auto debt: -23,411

To convert above inputs to standardized form, locate the Training Set Spreadsheet (first bottom tab of workbook) in the Data for Final
Project Workbook.

Data_for_final_project.xlsx

Use the input means [Cells C207:H207] and standard deviations [Cells C209:H209].

Use the Training Set profitability mean [$1,905.51] and standard deviation [$5755.91] from the Profit and Loss (last bottom tab) 
Spreadsheet. Use the Test Set standard deviation of error on standardized outputs of .6750

Question: What is the point estimate of profitability, in dollars?

Comment:

## Question 14: The following data are known about the sample applicant:

Age: 42.00
Years at Employer: 12.44
Years at Address: 0.9
Income: $121,400
CC debt: -34,228
Auto debt: -23,411

To convert above inputs to standardized form, locate the Training Set Spreadsheet (first bottom tab) in the Data for Final Project
Workbook.

Use those means [Cells C207:H207] and standard deviations [Cells C209:H209].

Use the Training Set profitability mean [$1,905.51] and standard deviation [$5755.91] from the Profit and Loss (last tab on bottom) 
Spreadsheet. Use the Test Set standard deviation of error on standardized outputs of .6750

Question: With 50% confidence, what is the range of profitability?

Auto debt: -23,411

To convert above inputs to standardized form, locate the Training Set Spreadsheet (bottom tab) in the Data for Final Project Workbook.
Use those means [Cells C207:H207] and standard deviations [Cells C209:H209].

Use the Training Set profitability mean [$1,905.51] and standard deviation [$5755.91] from the Profit and Loss (bottom tab) Spreadsheet
Use the Test Set standard deviation of error on standardized outputs of .6750 .
