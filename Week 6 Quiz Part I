Training set: 1 - 200
Test set: 201 - 400

Common mistakes
When you use test dataset, make sure you use the outcome for the test dataset too.
Sample Answer for Final Project
https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel/supplement/OHBGM

Question 1
Your model should have at least two data points. For instance, 
[Credit Score from -3.5 - 3.5] = constant + a*X1 + b*X2 + c*X3

Note: Although the quiz tool will tell you the answer you entered is correct, this is an automated answer. If fact, there is no 
exact answer and working through the final project will tell you if you have a viable model.

** To build your model**

There are many ways to build your model, and here is one simple way using Excel:
1) Identify highly correlated variables with the Outcome(the column with 1 and 0) by using LINEST function in Excel
2) Run regression analysis with the best correlated variables (Data analysis/Regression). More about Regression in Excel

Question 2
<.5 is not valid
.5 to < .59 is low value
.6 - .75 is ok
.75 - .86 is very good
>.86 is probably too good to be true

.7 r
((((Less than .5 is not correct - you need to make the highest value the lowest by
dividing by -1.
.5 has no predictive value.
.9 or higher is too good to be true!))))

Question 3
If the test set AUC is much worse than the training set AUC, consider making your model simpler – probably using fewer input variables
– as it is probably over-fitting the training set data.

Ideally, you would like a model to have only slightly lower performance on “new” data on which it was not trained. If you can develop
a model exclusively on training set data that has an AUC over [.72] and the training set data also shows an AUC over [.68], you are
doing very well. But don’t over-optimize your model on the test set data either, or it will turn out to be over-fitted on new,
“validation set” data.

((((<.5 is not valid - multiply by -1
.5 means no predictive value
> .90 is too good to be true!)))))

Question 4
Thresholds greater than 2.5 – not utilizing full range
Thresholds less than 2.5 – not utilizing full range

Comment:

Question 5 (Don't include "$")
Any answer > $1250 has no incremental value – is simply wrong
Any answer > $1000 is of minimal value

((((Thresholds greater than 2.5 may not be utilizing the full range for analysis � 
Thresholds less than -2.5 0 may not be utilizing the full range for analysis)))))))

Question 6
If you find that your costs per event on the test set are much higher than your costs per event on the training set, 
consider making your model simpler – probably using fewer input variables – as it is probably still over-fitting the training set data.
Problems that are were not obvious at the ROC-curve stage may emerge when minimizing costs.

Comment:
Finding the Minimum Cost Per Event
Question: Again referring only to the Training Set data, what is the overall minimum cost-per-event?
Hint: You will need this number to answer later questions. If you used the AUC

Calculator, the overall minimum cost per event will be displayed in Cell J2.
Note: for Coursera to interpret your answer correctly you must give your answer as an integer - no decimals or dollar sign. 
For Example - enter $800.00 as "800" 600 r

Question 7 (Don't include "$")
Must be $1250 minus previous answer.

<=$100 - poor
<100 to <= 250 – good
< 250 to <= 450 very good
>450 – excellent

Question 8 (Don't include "days")
Take the earning from each card and multiply by the number of credit card applicants per day will give you the money earned per day.

More than a week – poor
4-7 days – very good
2-3 days – excellent
1 day – too good to be true!

Question 9 (Don't include "%")

Defaulters test incidence 0% - poor
Defaulters test incidence 70 - 100% - poor
Defaulters test incidence >0 < 25% - ok
Defaulters test incidence >25% < 70% good
