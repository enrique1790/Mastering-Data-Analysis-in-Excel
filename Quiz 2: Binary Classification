Question 1 A test for “driving while intoxicated” was given 100 times. 20 people tested were actually intoxicated, and 10 people were 
mis-classified as intoxicated. What would the false positive rate be?

Given
a + b = c + d = 100
20 people tested were actually intoxicated => a = 20
10 people were mis-classified as intoxicated => g = 10

Find
False positive rate = g/b (12.5%)

Calculate

1) "b" based on "a + b = 100"
3) "False positive rate" based on False positive rate = g/b

Question 2 If a fire alarm malfunctions and fails to go off when there actually is a fire, that is a:
Alarm didn't go on --> Negative Classification
Alarm goes on --> Positive Classification
Answer: False Negative

Question 3 If the “classification incidence/test incidence” is 10% and the true “condition incidence” is 12%, the true positive rate:

Given
c = 10%
a = 12%

Compare True Positive rate (e/a) with 100%
Note: You don't have to calculate e, just think about whether e can be larger than a or not.
Answer: cannot be 100%

Question 4 - 7

To identify the threshold
1) Look for the minimum cost number and identify the rows corresponds to the minimum cost. (Ctrl + F: minimum cost calculated)
2) The optimal threshold level is the first number in the rows of minimum cost (highlight the identified rows and read the number in 
the first column)

Question 6 What is the lowest threshold value classified as “Positive” that achieves the optimal cost per test?
The answer is corrected now. The correct answer must satisfy three criteria:

1) Minimum cost
2) Classified as "Positive"
3) Lowest value

Q5) 
Set Columns:
Cost per False Negative (FN) : $15,000 
Cost per False Positive (FP) : $100 
Cost per Event: $25.98

Q6)
Cost per False Negative (FN) : $7,500
Cost per False Positive (FP) : $50 
Answer: The minimum Cost per Test ($12.99 vs $25.98)

Question 7 In general, increasing the cost per FN while keeping the cost per FP constant will cause the cost-minimizing threshold score
to:
Don't misinterpret "threshold score" to "cost", the question is asking how level of protein X37 is changing with the cost per FN. 
Try to adjust the FN cost in the Excel and you will see the answer. The reason is simple: increasing cost per FN will move the 
threshold towards less FN incidence. Then the quesiton becomes "which direction does the threshold move to reduce the number of FN? ".

Question 8-10
Make a copy of the Excel Bombers and Seagulls spreadsheet 3-1, 3-3A, 3-4 to answer Questions 8 to 10:Modify the spreadsheet data so 
that there are 4 bombers instead of 3 – with the 4th bomber having score 66 – and 16 seagulls instead of 17.

8. What is the new Area Under the Curve:

9. What is the new minimum cost per event?

10. What is the new threshold that minimizes the cost per event?
Use tab "3-1,3-3A, 3-4 Bombers Seagulls" part 3 to calculate the FP and TP rate, then use part 1 under the same tab to get AUC value.

Question 11 A population tested for “driving while intoxicated” has a Condition incidence of 20%. If the test has a true positive 
rate of 70% and a false positive rate of 10%, what is the test’s Positive Predictive Value (PPV)?
Please refer to the confusion matrix definition for this question, you won't need the following hint if you are able to do algebra.

Given

Condition incidence of 20% --> a = 0.2
True positive rate of 70% --> e/a = 0.7
False positive rate of 10% --> g/b = 0.1

Find
PPV = e/c

Calculations
calculate b, g, e and c using the following relations:
a + b =1
c = e + g
PPV = e/c

Question 12 In the example from the video of adding standardized heights and standardized weights, what is the False Positive rate 
if we choose a threshold between -1.33 and -1.28?

Refer to the Confusion Matrix definitions in Spreadsheet 3-2. You will see that the False Positive rate is simply the number of
Condition "-" or "0" above the threshold, divided by the total number of Condition "-" or "0."

Commentary:
I figured out what's up with Q12 on the graded week 2 quiz. You can find the "right" answer IF you realize 2 things:
1. The threshold is not included in "above the threshold"
AND
2. There's a typo in the problem (which is replicated in the answer explanation). The threshold is 25, not 24.
