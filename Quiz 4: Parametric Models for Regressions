Q1:Getting a z-score of 1.25 by (180-155)/20 is the first step. Use Excel's NORMSDIST function to find the percentage of athletes that 
weigh less than or equal to 180 pounds, =NORMSDIST((180-155)/20) . Subtract the result from 1 and you have the percentage of athletes 
thatweight more than 180 pounds.

Q2:"What upper bound for y will ensure that 95% of all possible outcomes for y will be below it?"
This is Practice 2 (Regression Model and PIG) Question 5.
The answer given by Coursera is =0.7+NORMSINV(0.95)*0.71 evaluates to 1.87.

However, I think the correct question to this question is 2.09, not the 1.87 suggested in the explanation. The difference is caused by the argument for the NORMSINV function.

=0.7+NORMSINV(0.95)*0.71 evaluates to 1.87 (coursera answer) =0.7+NORMSINV(0.5+0.95/2)*0.71 evaluates to 2.09.

The argument for the NORMSINV function should have been 0.5+0.95/2, not 0.95 as suggested in the explanation. The NORMSINV function returns the z-score such that NORM.S.DIST(z)=probability. In the context of the normal bell-shaped curve, the probability of the z-score for the upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval is the area to the left of the upper bound, which equals to 0.5+0.95/2.

### Mentor Hints for Week 4 Graded Quiz
Please post your questions here, I will answer them and summarize them in the main body. Happy learning!

Helpful Excel function
NORMDIST (x, mu, sigma, cumulative)
In NORMDIST, when the last argument is set to TRUE, NORMDIST returns the cumulative probability that the observed value of a Normal 
random variable with mean mu and standard deviation sigma will be less than or equal to x. If cumulative is set to FALSE 
(or 0, interpreted as FALSE), NORMDIST returns the height of the bell-shaped probability density curve. [Microsoft description]

SQRT()
Returns a positive square root.

LOG(number, [base])
Returns the logarithm of a number to the base you specify.

LINEST(known_y's, known_x's, intercept, statistics)
Perform linear regression. A least squares criterion is used, and LINEST tries to find the best fit under that criterion.
[Microsoft description]

The array's dimensions are five rows by a number of columns that is equal to the number of independent variables plus one if the 
third argument is set to TRUE (if the third argument is not set to TRUE, the number of columns is equal to the number of independent 
variables).

Question 3

Given
Sigma(X)=15, Sigma(Y)=10

Solve
Sigma(Z)

Calculations
Sigma(Z) = Sigma(X+Y) = SQRT((Sigma(X))^2+(Sigma(Y))^2)

Comment:
"If X and Y are random, and X's mean = 10, variance = 3, and Standard Deviation = 1.732050, how can I calculate Y's variance if y=2x+3.
I have been cheking the formulas and I don't find the solution."
The variance of y is 12. When you stretch a Gaussian distribution with a constant, the variance is magnified by the square of the 
constant. Y=2x+3. The constant is 2. Hence, the original variance is magnified by a factor of 2^2=4. 4*3=12. This is Q3 of the first 
practice quiz

Question 4
Use the Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Spreadsheet, 5-4 to solve the problem.

Question 6
Standardization: (x - average)/std. deviation
All other numbers can be found with Excel formula.

Question 7
R^2 = 1- (error)^2

Question 8
Error = sqrt(1 - R^2)
Differential Entropy=-log_2(Error)
