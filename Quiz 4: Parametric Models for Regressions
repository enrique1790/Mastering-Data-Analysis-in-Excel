Q1:Getting a z-score of 1.25 by (180-155)/20 is the first step. Use Excel's NORMSDIST function to find the percentage of athletes that 
weigh less than or equal to 180 pounds, =NORMSDIST((180-155)/20) . Subtract the result from 1 and you have the percentage of athletes 
thatweight more than 180 pounds.

Q2:"What upper bound for y will ensure that 95% of all possible outcomes for y will be below it?"
This is Practice 2 (Regression Model and PIG) Question 5.
The answer given by Coursera is =0.7+NORMSINV(0.95)*0.71 evaluates to 1.87.

However, I think the correct question to this question is 2.09, not the 1.87 suggested in the explanation. The difference is 
caused by the argument for the NORMSINV function.

=0.7+NORMSINV(0.95)*0.71 evaluates to 1.87 (coursera answer) =0.7+NORMSINV(0.5+0.95/2)*0.71 evaluates to 2.09.

The argument for the NORMSINV function should have been 0.5+0.95/2, not 0.95 as suggested in the explanation. The NORMSINV function 
returns the z-score such that NORM.S.DIST(z)=probability. In the context of the normal bell-shaped curve, the probability of the
z-score for the upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval is the area to the left of the upper bound, which equals to 0.5+0.95/2.

### Mentor Hints for Week 4 Graded Quiz (12 Questions)
Please post your questions here, I will answer them and summarize them in the main body. Happy learning!

### Helpful Excel function
NORMDIST (x, mu, sigma, cumulative)
In NORMDIST, when the last argument is set to TRUE, NORMDIST returns the cumulative probability that the observed value of a Normal 
random variable with mean mu and standard deviation sigma will be less than or equal to x. If cumulative is set to FALSE 
(or 0, interpreted as FALSE), NORMDIST returns the height of the bell-shaped probability density curve. [Microsoft description]

SQRT()
Returns a positive square root.

LOG(number, [base])
Returns the logarithm of a number to the base you specify.

LINEST(known_y's, known_x's, intercept, statistics)
Perform linear regression. A least squares criterion is used, and LINEST tries to find the best fit under that criterion.
[Microsoft description]

The array's dimensions are five rows by a number of columns that is equal to the number of independent variables plus one if the 
third argument is set to TRUE (if the third argument is not set to TRUE, the number of columns is equal to the number of independent 
variables).

Question 3

Given
Sigma(X)=15, Sigma(Y)=10

Solve
Sigma(Z)

Calculations
Sigma(Z) = Sigma(X+Y) = SQRT((Sigma(X))^2+(Sigma(Y))^2)

Comment:
"If X and Y are random, and X's mean = 10, variance = 3, and Standard Deviation = 1.732050, how can I calculate Y's variance if y=2x+3.
I have been cheking the formulas and I don't find the solution."
The variance of y is 12. When you stretch a Gaussian distribution with a constant, the variance is magnified by the square of the 
constant. Y=2x+3. The constant is 2. Hence, the original variance is magnified by a factor of 2^2=4. 4*3=12. This is Q3 of the first 
practice quiz

Question 4
Use the Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Spreadsheet, 5-4 to solve the problem.

Q5:
The correlation is not equal to the sum of the products of the z-scores. After you have computed the z-scores for each data point, 
use the CORREL function. The CORREL function takes two arguments, array1, array2. array1 is all z-scores for the X data set, array2 
is the z-scores for the Y data set.
Tip: To calculate the Z-score, instead of using the formula (xi-mean)/sigma, you can use Excel's STANDARDIZE function.

Question 6
Standardization: (x - average)/std. deviation
All other numbers can be found with Excel formula.

Comments:
Alpha is the y-intercept of the best fit line. It is not explained in great details in the lecture video, but it can be easily computed
if the slope and one point on the line is known. Or, if you have two sets of data points, plot a trend-line and Excel will display 
the equation of the linear model in the form y=beta*x+alpha.

For standardized data, alpha is 0 and the linear model becomes y=beta*x. The video mentioned it briefly. But you can experiment that 
yourself. If you have two sets of data, standardize them, then plot the z-scores on a XY-plane, the trend-line (or the best fit line)
runs through the origin.

Beta is the slope of the best fit line. No further explanation is needed.

R is the correlation coefficient. Usually, the correlation coefficient is given by Covariance(X,Y) / sigma(x)*sigma(y). Sigma is the 
standard deviation. However, for standardized data, R=Covariance=Beta. The instructor briefly mentioned the proof. I worked out the 
somewhat complicated details and present them below for those who are interested.

Standardized values are the z-scores. Covariance of standized values is Division by n, since this is a population covariance. 
For z-scores are standardized data, µx = 0 = µy . The above formula is reduced to

The correlation coefficient of the z-scores is therefore

Since the data points are standardized values, δ_𝑧𝑥 =1=δ_𝑧𝑦The correlation coefficient formula thus is reduced back to the covariance
formula. Hence, for standardized values, covariance=R
To prove the equality with beta, the mean squared errors of a best fit line is

Consider β as an unknow variable and differentiate the above function.This involes using the power rule and chain rule of 
differentiation. I will ommit the details here, since this is not a calculus class. After applying first the power rule, then
the chain rule, then simplification, the derivative is

Set the derivative to 0 and solve for β.

Taking into consideration that the data are standardized and the standard deviation of standard normal distribution is 1
Substitute this observation back to the expression for β and put the summation sign back

This is exactly the formula for covariance for the standardized values.Hence, we prove that for standardized values 
(the z-scores), β=R=Covariance

Question 7
R^2 = 1- (error)^2

Comment:
"What upper bound for y will ensure that 95% of all possible outcomes for y will be below it?"
This is Practice 2 (Regression Model and PIG) Question 5.
The answer given by Coursera is =0.7+NORMSINV(0.95)*0.71 evaluates to 1.87.
However, I think the correct question to this question is 2.09, not the 1.87 suggested in the explanation. 
The difference is caused by the argument for the NORMSINV function.

=0.7+NORMSINV(0.95)*0.71 evaluates to 1.87 (coursera answer) =0.7+NORMSINV(0.5+0.95/2)*0.71 evaluates to 2.09.

The argument for the NORMSINV function should have been 0.5+0.95/2, not 0.95 as suggested in the explanation. The NORMSINV function 
returns the z-score such that NORM.S.DIST(z)=probability. In the context of the normal bell-shaped curve, the probability of the
z-score for the upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval is the area to the left of the upper bound, which equals to 0.5+0.95/2.

Question 8
Error = sqrt(1 - R^2)
Differential Entropy=-log_2(Error)

customers as a function of a weighted sum of their past-years’ orders. The model error is assumed Gaussian with standard deviation 
of $130,000.
To the nearest dollar, what is the range above and below each Point Forecast required to have 90% confidence that the dollar 
value of next years’ orders will fall within that range?

standard deviation of $13.50. The restaurant experiments one Wednesday with changing the “special” from blue fish to lobster. The 
average amount spent by 85 customers is $77.20.

# Question 12
Your company currently has no way to predict how long visitors will spend on the Company’s web site. All it known is the average time
spent is 55 seconds, with an approximately Gaussian distribution and standard deviation of 9 seconds. It would be possible, after 
investing some time and money in analytics tools, to gather and analyzing information about visitors and build a linear predictive
model with a standard deviation of model error of 4 seconds.

How much would the P.I. G. of that model be?
