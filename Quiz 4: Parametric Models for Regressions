Q1:
A manufacturer has developed a specialized metal alloy for use in jet engines. In its pure form, the alloy starts to soften at 1500 F. 
However, small amounts of impurities in production cause the actual temperature at which the alloy starts to lose strength to vary
around that mean, in a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation = 10.5 degrees F.

If the manufacturer wants to ensure that no more than 1 in 10,000 of its commercial products will suffer from softening, what 
should it set as the maximum temperature to which the alloy can be exposed?
Hint: Refer to the Excel NormSFunctions Spreadsheet.

Answer: 1539.0497

Comments:
I did not encounter that question when I was taking the course, so would try my best to explain based on my current understandings.
If you are more comfortable with the statistical words, like significance level, then it might be understood this way:

Mean is 1500, standard deviation is 10.5, and significance level (alpha) is 1/10000 = 0.0001 = 0.01%

And because the alloy only softens at a higher temperature, but not a lower one, it is a one-tail problem. Then the temperature
threshold should be something where 0.01% of the cases are on the right of the threshold. Hope this helps, and happy to discuss further.
Best, Jane

Q2:
A carefully machined wire comes off an assembly line within a certain tolerance. Its target diameter is 100 microns, and the wires
produced have a uniform distribution of diameters, between -11 microns and +29 microns from the target.

What is the mean and standard deviation of the uniform distribution of wire diameters?
Hint: Use the CLT and Excel Rand() Spreadsheet.

link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel/discussions/weeks/4/threads/BnmIZIWGEeirLQoGavMecg

Answer: Mean = 109 microns, Standard Deviation = 11.547 microns.

Comments:
In the CLT and Excel Rand Spreadsheet, use cell C2 for a = 89 and cell E2 for b = 129. The formula for the standard deviation of a
uniform distribution is given in cell N3.

### Helpful Excel function
NORMDIST (x, mu, sigma, cumulative)
In NORMDIST, when the last argument is set to TRUE, NORMDIST returns the cumulative probability that the observed value of a Normal 
random variable with mean mu and standard deviation sigma will be less than or equal to x. If cumulative is set to FALSE 
(or 0, interpreted as FALSE), NORMDIST returns the height of the bell-shaped probability density curve. [Microsoft description]

SQRT()
Returns a positive square root.

LOG(number, [base])
Returns the logarithm of a number to the base you specify.

LINEST(known_y's, known_x's, intercept, statistics)
Perform linear regression. A least squares criterion is used, and LINEST tries to find the best fit under that criterion.
[Microsoft description]

The array's dimensions are five rows by a number of columns that is equal to the number of independent variables plus one if the 
third argument is set to TRUE (if the third argument is not set to TRUE, the number of columns is equal to the number of independent 
variables).

Question 3
Given
Sigma(X)=15, Sigma(Y)=10

Solve
Sigma(Z)

Calculations
Sigma(Z) = Sigma(X+Y) = SQRT((Sigma(X))^2+(Sigma(Y))^2)

Answer: .0173%

Comment:
Can somebody help me understand why we calculate with positive z-score ( 1 –NormSDist(3.577)) while z-score of the sample average of 
112 is (112-120)/2.236 = -3.577 is negative? Wouldn't make more sense (and shorter) just take NormSDist of actual negative z-score: 
=NormSDist(-3.577))? Is my understanding of the area we are looking for correct on the attached diagram? Thanks in advance

You are correct . You will get correct answer if you calculate NORMSDIST (- 3.5777).

Question 4
Two stocks have the following expected annual returns:

Oil stock – expected return = 9% with standard deviation = 13%
IT stock – expected return = 14% with standard deviation = 25%
The Stocks prices have a small negative correlation: R = -.22.

What is the Covariance of the two stocks?
Hint: Use the Algebra with Gaussians Spreadsheet.

Answer: -.00715

Comment:
Covariance is defined as R*Std.Dev(1)*Std.Dev(2).

Q5:
The correlation is not equal to the sum of the products of the z-scores. After you have computed the z-scores for each data point, 
use the CORREL function. The CORREL function takes two arguments, array1, array2. array1 is all z-scores for the X data set, array2 
is the z-scores for the Y data set.
Tip: To calculate the Z-score, instead of using the formula (xi-mean)/sigma, you can use Excel's STANDARDIZE function.

Answer: -.22

Comments:
Standardization changes covariance to equal correlation. Standardization leaves correlation unchanged. See the Standardization 
Spreadsheet.

Question 6
Two stocks have the following expected annual returns:

Oil stock – expected return = 9% with standard deviation = 13%
IT stock – expected return = 14% with standard deviation = 25%
The Stocks prices have a small negative correlation: R = -.22.

What is the standard deviation of a portfolio consisting of 70% Oil and 30% IT?
Hint: Use either the Algebra with Gaussians or the Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Spreadsheet.

Standardization: (x - average)/std. deviation
All other numbers can be found with Excel formula.

Answer: 

Comments:
Use the Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Spreadsheet. Enter Oil Expected return in Cell C6, Oil standard deviation in cell C7, 
IT expected return in Cell D6, IT standard deviation in Cell D7, Oil weighting in Cell C9 and IT weighting in Cell D9. Results in
Cell E12.

Question 7
R^2 = 1- (error)^2

Answer: 10.36%

Comment:
"What upper bound for y will ensure that 95% of all possible outcomes for y will be below it?"
This is Practice 2 (Regression Model and PIG) Question 5.
The answer given by Coursera is =0.7+NORMSINV(0.95)*0.71 evaluates to 1.87.
However, I think the correct question to this question is 2.09, not the 1.87 suggested in the explanation. 
The difference is caused by the argument for the NORMSINV function.

=0.7+NORMSINV(0.95)*0.71 evaluates to 1.87 (coursera answer) =0.7+NORMSINV(0.5+0.95/2)*0.71 evaluates to 2.09.

The argument for the NORMSINV function should have been 0.5+0.95/2, not 0.95 as suggested in the explanation. The NORMSINV function 
returns the z-score such that NORM.S.DIST(z)=probability. In the context of the normal bell-shaped curve, the probability of the
z-score for the upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval is the area to the left of the upper bound, which equals to 0.5+0.95/2.

Question 8
Error = sqrt(1 - R^2)
Differential Entropy=-log_2(Error)

An automobile parts manufacturer uses a linear regression model to forecast the dollar value of the next years’ orders from current 
customers as a function of a weighted sum of their past-years’ orders. The model error is assumed Gaussian with standard deviation 
of $130,000.
To the nearest dollar, what is the range above and below each Point Forecast required to have 90% confidence that the dollar 
value of next years’ orders will fall within that range?
Hint: you can answer this question by making small modifications to the Correlation and Model Error Spreadsheet.

Comments:
A 90% confidence interval means 5% above and 5% below the interval. Using p = .95, Excel "Normsinv(.95)" = 1.64485. 
This is the z-Score. Therefore the interval ranges from (1.64485)*($130,00) or $213,831 below the point forecast, to 
(1.64485)*($130,000) = $213,831 above the forecast.


Q9: 
LINEST Function can be automatically calculated using 'Analysis Toolpack' excel Add-In. Once this add is loaded into the excel, you may
want to click on Data --> Data Analysis and select 'Regression' from the number of available analysis tools. Then you will be
prompted following screen:

As shown on the above screenshot, you may want to click on the Confidence Level check box (default confidence level is 95%). 
You may also want to select the 'New Worksheet' to display the output (otherwise your existing excel sheet may get messy). And 
finally, you may want to select the Residuals and Standardized Residuals check boxes. And click on OK button.

Excel will do it's magic and show you the summary of the analysis as follows:
All the details that LINEST function provides you are summarized precisely on the Summary Sheet.

#An automobile parts manufacturer uses a linear regression model to forecast the dollar value of the next years’ orders from current 
customers as a function of a weighted sum of their past-years’ orders. The model error is assumed Gaussian with standard deviation of 
$130,000.

If the correlation is R = .33, and the point forecast orders $5.1 million, what is the probability that the customer will order more 
than $5.3 million?
Hint: Use the Typical Problem with NormSDist Spreadsheet.

Comments:
Convert $5.3 million to a z-score. The z-Score is (5.3-5.1)/.13 = (.2/.13) = 1.538.
Input the z-score in the Excel formula (1 - Normsdist(z)) to get the probability of a score at least that high. 
The probability is 1- 93.8% = 6.2%.

# Question 10
An automobile parts manufacturer uses a linear regression model to forecast the dollar value of the next years’ orders from current 
customers as a function of a weighted sum of that customer’s past-years orders. The linear correlation is R = .33.

After standardizing the x and y data, what portion of the uncertainty about a customer’s order size is eliminated by their historical
data combined with the model?

Hint: Use the Correlation and P.I.G. Spreadsheet.

# Question 11
A restaurant offers different dinner “specials” each weeknight. The mean cash register receipt per table on Wednesdays is $75.25 with 
standard deviation of $13.50. The restaurant experiments one Wednesday with changing the “special” from blue fish to lobster. The 
average amount spent by 85 customers is $77.20.

How probable is it that Wednesday receipts are better than average by chance alone?
Hint: Use the Typical Problem with NormSDist Spreadsheet.

Link: 
https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel/discussions/weeks/4/threads/oyWTgopZEeaHRwr5_eYMew

Comments:
The Z-score for Wednesdays is (77.20 – 75.25)/ 13.50/(sqrt(85) = 1.33. The probability that this much improvement would be due to 
chance alone, not the change of special, is (1 - NormSDist(1.33)).
Note that due to the Central Limit Theorem, even though the receipts may not have a Gaussian distribution, the sample means will
have a Gaussian distribution so that use of the NormSDist function is appropriate.

# Question 12
Your company currently has no way to predict how long visitors will spend on the Company’s web site. All it known is the average time
spent is 55 seconds, with an approximately Gaussian distribution and standard deviation of 9 seconds. It would be possible, after 
investing some time and money in analytics tools, to gather and analyzing information about visitors and build a linear predictive
model with a standard deviation of model error of 4 seconds.

How much would the P.I. G. of that model be? 
Hint: Use the Correlation and P.I.G. Spreadsheet

https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel/discussions/weeks/4/threads/a6f1cf3vEeea5g61AFAY_A

Comments:
With no model, the correlation R = 0 and the “model error” is equal to the standard deviation of Y = 9 seconds. Standardized, 
the model error when R = 0 is equal to 1. Reducing the model error to 4 seconds is equivalent to reducing the standardized model 
error to 4/9 = .4444 Since Sqrt(1-R^2) = .4444, R^2 = 1- .4444^2 = .8958.
