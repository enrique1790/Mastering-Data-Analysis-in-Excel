Q1:Getting a z-score of 1.25 by (180-155)/20 is the first step. Use Excel's NORMSDIST function to find the percentage of athletes that 
weigh less than or equal to 180 pounds, =NORMSDIST((180-155)/20) . Subtract the result from 1 and you have the percentage of athletes 
thatweight more than 180 pounds.

Helpful Excel function
NORMDIST (x, mu, sigma, cumulative)
In NORMDIST, when the last argument is set to TRUE, NORMDIST returns the cumulative probability that the observed value of a Normal 
random variable with mean mu and standard deviation sigma will be less than or equal to x. If cumulative is set to FALSE 
(or 0, interpreted as FALSE), NORMDIST returns the height of the bell-shaped probability density curve. [Microsoft description]

SQRT()
Returns a positive square root.

LOG(number, [base])
Returns the logarithm of a number to the base you specify.

LINEST(known_y's, known_x's, intercept, statistics)
Perform linear regression. A least squares criterion is used, and LINEST tries to find the best fit under that criterion.
[Microsoft description]

The array's dimensions are five rows by a number of columns that is equal to the number of independent variables plus one if the 
third argument is set to TRUE (if the third argument is not set to TRUE, the number of columns is equal to the number of independent 
variables).

Question 3

Given
Sigma(X)=15, Sigma(Y)=10

Solve
Sigma(Z)

Calculations
Sigma(Z) = Sigma(X+Y) = SQRT((Sigma(X))^2+(Sigma(Y))^2)

Question 4
Use the Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Spreadsheet, 5-4 to solve the problem.

Question 6
Standardization: (x - average)/std. deviation
All other numbers can be found with Excel formula.

Question 7
R^2 = 1- (error)^2

Question 8
Error = sqrt(1 - R^2)
Differential Entropy=-log_2(Error)
