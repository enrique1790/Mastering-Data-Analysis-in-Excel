Excel uses standard "PEMDAS" Order of operations for arithmetic
:Parentheses, Exponenets, Multiplication and Division, And Addition and Subtraction"

Parentheses "(6-3)"
Exponenets - use caret "^" (for example, "six squared" is "6^2"; "square root of six" is " 6^(.5)")
Multipliations- use asterisk "*"
Divison- use slash "/"
Addition "+"
Subtraction "-"

Assume we want (6-3)(4+2) = 18
Excel: =(6-3)*(4+2)
