Columns:
= Sign makes a formula active
Selecting and dragging down Sums relative columns based off your formula
--> if you double click on the right corner of your column this will perform the same action.
you can also edit formulas in the formula bar
--> When solving problems it's recommending you use an absolute reference. (Recognized as a $ sign in Excel)

Graph: charts --> Scatter --> straight mark scatter

absolute reference: Interest Rate (you can change and adjust the value from this column with having to edit all relative columns.)

Excel uses standard "PEMDAS" Order of operations for arithmetic
:Parentheses, Exponenets, Multiplication and Division, And Addition and Subtraction"

Parentheses "(6-3)"
Exponenets - use caret "^" (for example, "six squared" is "6^2"; "square root of six" is " 6^(.5)")
Multipliations- use asterisk "*"
Divison- use slash "/"
Addition "+"
Subtraction "-"

Assume we want (6-3)(4+2) = 18
Excel: =(6-3)*(4+2)

*natural log 
Excel: "ln"
Example: =ln(1.5)

*log to the base 2 
Excel: "log(number,base)"
Example: =log(1.5,2)

*pi
Excel: "pi()"
Example: =1/PI()^0.5)

Generates a Random number between 0 and 1
Excel: =RAND()


### Functions on Arrays

Columns:
S&P 500 INDEX:  -->Excel: =LN(B4/B5)
Duke Energy Stock: -->Excel: =LN(C4/C5)

**Summarizing quantitative data**
Columns:
Average Month Return --> [S&P 500 Index] AVERAGE(D4:D178) ; [Duke Energy Stock] AVERAGE(E4:E178)
Average Anuual Return --> [S&P 500 Index] Excel: =G6*12 ;  [Duke Energy Stock] Excel: =H6*12
Standard Deviation of monthly Returns --> [S&P 500 Index]  Excel: =STDEV.P(D4:D178);  [Duke Energy Stock] 
Annualized Stard Deviation of Returns --> [S&P 500 Index];  [Duke Energy Stock] 
Minimum -->[S&P 500 Index]   ;  [Duke Energy Stock] 
Maximum --> [S&P 500 Index];  [Duke Energy Stock] 

**Regression Model**
