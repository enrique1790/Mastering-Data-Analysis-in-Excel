Example 1:

What is your predictive model?
Model: (Credit Card debt + Automobile debt) / income (The negatives are removed from the debt).
This will give an AUC of 0.74 in the training set
Example: For the given example if we use the above model the score would be 0.53.
The threshold for my model is 0.60
The score is below the threshold and the applicant will be rejected. 

Example: For the given example if we use the above model the score would be 0.53.
The threshold for my model is 0.60
The score is below the threshold and the applicant will be rejected.

AUC = 0.74
Total Profit = $4000*0.74 = 2960

Average cost per event for the model = 977
Incrementaol financial Value per applicant = 1775 -977 =$798

When tested on the Test set the model got the following out puts:
AUC = 0.73
Average cost per event = 969
At the threshold same as that of training set i.e. 0.6 the cost per event is 1033

Somewhat confident.

Example 2:
I used the data for training set and got two models using the LINEST function. The first one reveals the relation between profit
and all six inputs.

The second one reveals the relation between default and all sic inputs.
ABOUT PROFIT: y=5.947age+158.782employment-613.343address+0.077income-0.082card_debt-0.004auto_debt-3199.975
ABOUT DEFAULT: y=0.01age+0.19employment-0.07address+0.64income-0.06card_debt-0.005auto_debt

Age: -0.06
Years at employer: 0.23
Years at address: -0.58
Income: -0.38
Credit card debt: 0.14
Auto debt: -0.06
y=-0.1649
using the model ABOUT DEFAULT, he got a score below 0 when assessing his possibility of default.
He would be rejected for a credit card, for the score he got is below 0, which means he is much likely to default.

I used the model ABOUT PROFIT to predict the profit and after adding them together, I got the answer of $1913.8 for 
average profit per applicant.

$138.80 ($138.80 = $1913.8 - $1775, $1913.8 is the answer given in the last question and $1775 is the profit without a model)

Not at all.

I give the answer taking the profit per applicant as a main weighing elements.
It is unfortunate for me to get a lower average profit per applicant on the test set, which means my model might be overfitting for
the training set.

Example 3:
My predictive model is: ( Standardized Income + Standardized Credit Card Debt + Standardized Automobile Debt)  10 * 
(Standardized Age + Standardized Years at Employer)
Applying the model:the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is .73.the Minimum Cost Per Event is $891.5 and is at threshold -1.2.
b. Refer to the text box below for a response to part b of the question 2

Using the predictive model, the applicant listed in the question would have the following score: 
( Standardized Income + Standardized Credit Card Debt + Standardized Automobile Debt)  10 * (Standardized Age + Standardized Years at
Employer)-(-0.38 + .14 + -0.06) 10 * (-0.06 + .23)) = 2.00Since 2.00 is higher than the threshold of -1.2 (previously stated),
the applicant would be included in the selection (would be approved).

Using the predictive model on the Training Set, the average profit per applicant is:141(True Positive Count) * 4,000 
(Average Profits per Profitable Customer) =$564,000 + 7 (False Negative Count) * -4,900 (Average Loses per Unprofitable Customer) 
= -34,300= $529,700Divided by 200= $2,648.50

Using the predictive model (compared to no model), the incremental financial value on the Training Set is:
4,900 (Cost per False Negative) * 25% (proportion of unprofitable applicants) = $1,225-$891.5 (Predictive Model Minimum Cost per Event)
= $333.5

Using the predictive model on the Test Set, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is .74.
Additionally, using the threshold of -1.2 (from the predictive model on the training set), the minimum cost per event $1,192. 
Using the test set data, the average profit per applicant is:
134 (True Positive Count) * 4,000 (Average Profits per Profitable Customer) =$536,000+16 (False Negative Count) 
* -4,900 (Average Loses per Unprofitable Customer) =-78,400
= $457,600
Divided by 200
= $2,288.00
Since the average profit is lower under the Test Set (compared to the Training Set)
but higher than the average profit per applicant using no model, I am somewhat confident that the predictive model does not over-fit
the Training Set data.
