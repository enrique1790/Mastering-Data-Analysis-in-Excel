It's last weeks spreadsheet. The Linear -Regression Workbook. The second tab '5-2 Central Limit Theorem".

Question 1 Suppose we have a 250 data points distributed from 0 to 100. If we have 30 data points in bin [10, 20], how tall is the 
bin [10, 20] in the “probability histogram”?

Height of the bin [10, 20] in the “probability histogram” = number of data points in the range of the bin divided by the total number 
of data points

Question 2 Suppose we have a range of outcomes between -10 to 10 that we divide into 5 bins of equal width. What is the smallest
bin mean among the 5 bins?
The smallest bin mean among the 5 bins=(-10+(-6))/2

Comment:
the question tells you there are outcomes from -10 to 10 divided equally over 5 bins. that's 20 outcomes divided by 5 bins, so each 
bin has a width of 4 outcomes.

You can visualize the range of each bin in this way.
Bin 1: -10 to -6
Bin 2: -6 to -2
Bin 3: -2 to 2
Bin 4: 2 to 6
Bin 5: 6 to 10
and the bin with the smallest mean will be the one with the smallest range of outcomes from -10 to -6.
Therefore the mean of Bin 1 is (-10+(-6))/2

Question 3 True/False: A Gaussian distribution is more skewed than a uniform continuous distribution with the same variance.
Gaussian distribution and uniform continuous distribution are both symmetric, and skewness is 0.

Question 4 A Gaussian distribution has higher entropy than a uniform continuous distribution with the same variance.

Entropy(Gaussian distribution)=2.05+log_2⁡σ
Variance(uniform continuous distribution)=(b-a)^2/12=σ^2
Entropy(uniform continuous distribution)=log_2⁡ (b-a)=1.79+log_2⁡σ
Therefore, Entropy (Gaussian distribution) > Entropy(uniform continuous distribution) with the same variance.

Question 5 Suppose we have a continuous uniform distribution on [-2,4]. What is its variance?
Variance(uniform continuous distribution)=(b-a)^2 / 12

Question 6 True/False: In a scatterplot of 100 ordered pairs drawn from two Gaussian random variables with mean = 0, variance = 1, 
and correlation R = 0, it is possible to get a correlation of the ordered pairs = 0.99.

Think about what a correlation of 0.99 means.

Comment:
Is the correct answer "False"? Correlation measures the degree of associations between two variables. The order pairs were drawn
from two Gaussian random variables with correlation R=0, that means the two random variables are independent.
If R=0.99, that means the ordered pairs are almost perfectly associated. That is not possible if the ordered pairs are drawn from 
two independent sources.

Question 7 Which of the following statements about over-fitting is false:

Comment:
The Modification Factor does have an impact on the cost per event.

1. Raw scores (column A) are standardized (column B) and divided by the Modification Factor (column C) to bound the raw scores 
in the range [-3.5,3.5].

2. The final scores in column D, which are copied over from column C, are then compared to the threshold in row 10 (H10:ER10). 
If the final score is greater than the threshold, then Excel returns the value in the Reversed Outcome column (column F). The 
returned values are stores in H225:ER424

3. H225:ER424 is then summed up to give the total False Positive at each threshold (Row 13).

4. The cost per event (row 17) at the threshold 3.5 is calculated by "=(($I$4*H16)+($I$2*H13))/$D$8", at the threshold 3.45
is calculated by "=(($I$4*I16)+($I$2*I13))/$D$8", and so on.

The key observation here is that the formula for the cost per event uses inputs from row 13, which implicitly uses the
Modification Factor (as I explained in Step 1 to 3 above). This is just one way the cost per event implicitly depends on the 
Modification Factor

Changing it from -1 to -2 does change the minimum cost, that's because the way the cost per event is calculated. 
Cost Per Event = ((FN*cost per FN) + (FP*Cost per FP)) / Total Events. First, changing the factor from -1 to -2 does not 
change the sign of the adjusted final scores, which means if the final score is above the threshold in row 10 when the factor is 1,
it is likely still above the threshold. Second, changing the factor from -1 to -2 halves the previous result. The thresholds in 
row 10 change by a tiny increment of 0.05. All the unadjusted standardized scores in column B are greater than 2*0.05.
Halving them will not change the range a score falls in. Combining these two reasons, it is not difficult to see why changing 
the Modification Factor from -1 to -2 has no impact on the minimum cost per event.

However, changing the Modification Factor from -1 to 1 will obviously change the range an adjusted final score falls in. 
If an adjusted final score is above the threshold when the factor is -1, it will be below the same threshold when the factor
is changed to 1.

=MIN(H17:ER17) returns $1,250 when the factor is 1 but returns $975 when the factor is -1.


Question 8:
A traditional academic point system for grading AUC.

.90-1 = excellent (A)
.80-.90 = good (B)
.70-.80 = fair (C)
.60-.70 = poor (D)
.50-.60 = fail (F)
Reference: http://gim.unmc.edu/dxtests/roc3.htm )

AUC of 0.5 probably had resulted from diagonally straight ROC curve that originates from the origin (0,0) and ends at (1,1). 
Such a line has a slope of 1, which implies that an improvement in True Positive rate always comes at the price of an equal amount
increase in False Positive rate, regardless of the thresholds being used, i.e., every time the model correctly identified one more
bomber, it also falsely identified a seagull as a bomber at the same time. Every time the alarm goes off, there is a 50/50 chance 
that it is either a bomber or a seagull. Such a model is useless.
